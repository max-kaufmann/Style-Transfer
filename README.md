# Style-Transfer

My implementation of neural style transfer, as described in  Leon A. Gatysâ€™ paper "A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style", and in Raymond Yuan's article "Art with Deep Learning using tf.keras and eager execution".

To run the style transfer, sipmly execute the command:

"./training.py picture1 picture2 num_iterations" 

where picture1 is the base content image, picture2 is the target image and num_iterations
describes how many times the optimisation loop is ran.

Also included is a short piece I did on some art I enjoy.
